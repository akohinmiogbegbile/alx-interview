<h2>Minimum Operations</h2>

<p>
In a text file, there is a single character H. Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file: Copy All and Paste. Given a number n, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n H characters in the file.
</p>
 <ul>
 <li>Prototype: def minOperations(n)</li>
 <li>Returns an integer</li>
 <li>If n is impossible to achieve, return 0</li>
 </ul>

<h4>Example:</h4>
<p>n = 9</p>
<p>
H => Copy All => Paste => HH => Paste =>HHH => Copy All => Paste => HHHHHH => Paste => HHHHHHHHH
</p>
 <p>
 Number of operations: 6
