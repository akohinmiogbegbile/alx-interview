## Lockboxes

You have n number of locked boxes in front of you. Each box is numbered sequentially from 0 to n - 1 and each box may contain keys to the other boxes.

Write a method that determines if all the boxes can be opened.

### Function Prototype

```python
def canUnlockAll(boxes)
```

- `boxes` is a list of lists
- A key with the same number as a box opens that box
- You can assume all keys will be positive integers
- There can be keys that do not have boxes
- The first box `boxes[0]` is unlocked
- Return `True` if all boxes can be opened, else return `False`

### Example

```python
boxes = [[1], [2], [3], [4], []]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes))  # Output: True

boxes = [[1, 4, 6], [2], [0, 4, 1], [5, 6, 2], [3], [4, 1], [6]]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes))  # Output: True

boxes = [[1, 4], [2], [0, 4, 1], [3], [], [4, 1], [5, 6]]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes))  # Output: False
```
